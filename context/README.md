# Project Context

This `context/` directory is the project’s knowledge base for AI-assisted development.

- Put design notes, plans, tasks, issue tracking, and reusable prompts here.
- Keep docs lightweight and up to date; prefer small focused markdown files.

Directory layout is based on `magic-context/instructions/dir-setup/make-context-dir.md`.
